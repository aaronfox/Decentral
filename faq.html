    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>What problem does DeCentral solve?</h3>
    <p>
      The banking and lending industries are designed for the middle and higher classes to easily access money.
      This leaves behind the lower class, which consists of 15% of Americans, or 45 million people.
      The lower class has very limited access to money and is vulnerable to predatory lending.
      DeCentral is designed for the 15% of Americans who don’t have easy access to money.
      DeCentral is a DeCentralized platform designed to facilitate micro lending to all groups of people through
      a state of the art peer to peer lending model. We give the power to each individual user to negotiate the terms
      and conditions of the loans they give out and the loans they receive. Users can decide who to lend their money to
      by using our database of lendee information. This gives the lender the power to decide who is a qualified lendee,
      ignoring the standard credit score system that banks use.
    </p>
    <h3>How it works?</h3>
    <p>
      There are two ways DeCentral works, one for the investor or lender trying to make a great return over a short
      time period, and one for the lendee who needs access to cash but doesn’t quite have the credit score or credit
      history to get a loan. Both the lender and the lendee would create accounts, inputting information linking their
      bank accounts to their DeCentral account. This is to simplify and expedite the transfer of funds process.

      For the “investor”, they would navigate the “Auction House” page and search for a user that they believe is a
      qualified lendee. They would negotiate an amount and interest rate that pleases both parties. Once the details
      of the transaction are agreed upon, a legally binding document would be sent to both parties, clearly stating the
      terms of the loan.

      For the “lendee” or person requesting the loan, simply create a “loan needed” ticket, or navigate our investors
      page and connect with one of them. Once you have come to an agreement, sign the legally binding contract and your
      funds will be deposited into your bank account.

    <h3>Our Loan credit rating system</h3>
    <p>
      Our loan credit rate system is based off of the total number of loans you have successfully paid. Using this system,
      users will be allowed to borrow more money only when they have proved they can repay previous loans. Users initially
      can only borrow up to $1,000 until successfully repaying their loans. This means their total of loans outstanding
      can’t exceed $1,000. After 3 successfully paid loans, the user will bump up to the $2,000 limit. This scales up to
      our $5,000 loan limit.

    <p>
      When a user defaults on a loan, they are given a onetime two week grace period to make the proposed payment.
      If the user has not made the payment by the end of the grace period, a default will be triggered. The defaulted
      user will then be given a credit rating of Z, capping their loan amount to $300. If the user defaults a second time,
      the user will be banned from using our service.
